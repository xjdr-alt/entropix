"""Orchestrates the engines with performance optimization for inference.

1. A client sends a DecodeRequest via gRPC to the server, an 'EntropixOrchestrator'.
2. This gets wrapped as an 'ActiveRequest' inside the orchestrator, with a
    'return_channel' queue as a place that output tokens can be placed.
    - The ActiveRequest is placed on the 'prefill_queue'.
    - A while loop runs continuously, yielding any tokens placed on the return
      channel until an end condition is met (EOS token or max tokens).
3. There is a prefill_thread per prefill_engine, each of which runs on a
    distinct prefill_slice.
4. There is a generate_thread per generate_engine, each of which runs on a
    distinct generate_slice.
5. Within a prefill thread:
    - It attempts to pop ActiveRequests off the prefill_queue.
    - It tokenizes the request.
    - When successful, it performs a prefill operation, transfers the kv cache
      to the generation slice and pops this information (still wrapped in the
      same ActiveRequest) onto the generation queue.
6. Within a generation thread:
   - There is a queue of integers representing 'available slots'.
   - It checks if there is something on both the slots_queue and generation_
     queue.
   - If so, the kv_cache associated with that request into the decoding state
    of the generation loop at the relevant slot.
   - Regardless, it performs a step.
  - It takes the sampled tokens, and places them on a 'detokenizing_queue'.
7. Within the detokenizing thread:
  - Tokens are detokenized for every 'slot' in a given set of sampled tokens.
  - When an end condition is met, the 'slot' integer is returned to the
    respective generation queue.
  - This does mean that a single generation step may run after detokenizing
    indicates that row is no longer valid (if the detokenizing is running behind
    generation steps), this is fine as it avoids detokenizing being blocking of
    the generate thread.

If you haven't worked with concurrency in python before - queues are thread-safe
by default, so we can happily use them to transfer pointers to data between
different processes. The structure of this server is simple as a result - a
thread for each thing we might want to do (prefill, transfer, generate,
detokenize), and corresponding queues that an active request is passed between.
The same goes for the 'return_channel' of the request itself, where we can just
pop tokens once they are done and try to pop them back to transmit them over
grpc.
It is literally queues all the way down! :)
The primary concern is GIL contention between threads, which is why we block
on queues that don't have an ongoing activity (i.e. everything but the
generation queue) because we don't control to go back to those queues until
necessary. Blocking means that the GIL doesn't switch back to that thread,
wheras continual queue get operations 'chop' control and mean that we do not
achieve good throughput. This is okay on the prefill/transfer/detokenization
threads because we don't need to do anything other than react to the presence
of items on these queues, wheras the generation thread needs to also run a
step - so it cannot block until it has new things to insert.
